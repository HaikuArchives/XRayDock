To do: 

-> FULL OF THINGS! 

use the wheel mouse button to preview the windows! 


1 - keep the original look of the icons or pictures 

2 - reduce the size of the icons if there are too many 

4 - for icons designating a folder create a list of file contents 

5 - to choose the name of the icon and not his way; the default path is shown as a name has not been given. 

## 6 - to adapt if change workspace 

## 7 - settle the crash when images are missing ... you have to put one in the place!
